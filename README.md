# Microsoft-Q-
Q# is the language developed by Microsoft, which can be used on many quantum algorithms. It should be driven by C#. This project is based on the [Q# tutorial document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quantum-writeaquantumprogram?view=qsharp-preview&tabs=tabid-vs2017) given by Microsoft. I meet some problems during the project, even though most of the work is only copy-paste. What is more, I would like to include some knowledge on quantum computing during the process.
